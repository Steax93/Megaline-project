# Megaline-project
Third project from data science boot camp
This time I worked as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. My main goal was to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan generates more revenue. In this work, I found the monthly revenue from each user, how much each of them requires the minutes, texts, and volume of data per month, and made a description of the distributions. And finally, in my last step, I tested the hypotheses and conclude.
